# Test Repository

This repository is a small sandbox for practicing Git and GitHub workflows with
simple Java controller stubs. It is intentionally minimal and does not include
a build system.

## Repository Layout
- `src/main/controller/`: Example Java classes used for demos.
- `.github/`: Issue and pull request templates.

## Getting Started
No runtime or build configuration is included. If you want to turn this into a
runnable project, add a build tool (Maven or Gradle) and move the sources under
`src/main/java`.

## Contributing
See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
